and repeated movement occurs.**

The moving part is normally contrasting with the stillness of the rest of the
image, this is why most, the description is talking about *minor* movement.

This phenomenon has become quite popular lately, and can be absolutely
mesmerizing when correctly done.

They are mostly distributed in gif, gif always play in loops, but a cinemagraph
should be made so the loop point is almost unnoticeable.

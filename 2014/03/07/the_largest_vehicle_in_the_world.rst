The Largest Vehicles in the world
=================================

There are various type vehicles and there are therefore various record holders,
so lets summarize that a little.

Largest two-axle
----------------

The most known, huge two-axle is the *Caterpillar 797*:

.. image:: /_static/largest_vehicles/cat797.jpg

But it is quite close to the *Liebherr T 282B*:

.. image:: /_static/largest_vehicles/liebherr_t282.jpg

And the *Bucyrus MT6300AC*:

.. image:: /_static/largest_vehicles/mt6300ac.jpg

This beasts are haul trucks of 400 `short ton
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_ton>`_ capacity, with quite impressive
dimension, with no clear winner

========= ========= ========= =========
dimension 797F      T282B     mt6300ac
========= ========= ========= =========
height    7.44 m    7.32 m    7.92 m
width     9.53 m    9.09 m    9.70 m
length    15.09 m   15.32 m   15.57m
weight¹   623700 kg 596900 kg 603300 kg
========= ========= ========= =========

*¹: this is Gross Machine Operating Weight*

Depending of the criteria you use, you can give the prize to the 797F aor the
MT6300AC, knowing the T292B is always close.

Largest mobile artillery weapon
-------------------------------

The *Gustav Gun*, is the name used for the two German 80cm railway guns. You
read that right, 80cm, is the caliber, the diameter of the ammunition if you
prefer. They were named *Schwerer Gustav* and *Dora*, here is a picture of a
model version of *Dora*:

This were developed in the late 30's and were 47.3 meter long and weigthed 1490
short tons (to stay in the same measures as previously used in this article).

The `Schwerer Gustav <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_gun>`_ Wikipedia page
contains more information, and nice pictures for scale, of the gun itself, and
its ammunition.


Largest construction vehicle
----------------------------

The Terex RH400 is caterpillar track vehicle that is apparently a bigger than
our two axle beasts we saw before, you can see it filling a 797B:

You can have a look at its `specifications
<http://www.ritchiespecs.com/specification?type=construction+equipment&category=Shovel&make=Terex&model=RH400&modelid=107772>`_
by yourself, but here is a little summary:

- height: 10.17 m
- width: 8.6m and that's the tracks, the body is even larger
- shovel can reach 20.2 m up

Largest terrestrial vehicle
---------------------------

This is, by far, the Bagger series, the most known is the Bagger 288:

.. image:: /_static/largest_vehicles/bagger288.jpg

This behemoth is a *bucket-wheel excavator* thas weight 13500 tons, its length
can go up to 220 m and it goes as high as 96 m for a with of 46 m.

And yes, it is a *vehicle* and can move up to 0.6km/h, not the fastest, but
movies 13500 tons at this speed is already quite amazing. Even with the
preparation needed to allow it to move, it was moved in 2001 by 22km, this was
told to be less expensive than tear it apart and rebuild on the second
location.

Bagger 288 is one of a group of similar sized and built vehicles, such as Bagger
281 (built in 1958), Bagger 285 (1975), Bagger 287 (1976), Bagger 293 (1995).

Largest ship
------------

If the *Bagger 288* is the behemoth of man-made vehicles, the *Seawise Giant*
was the leviathan.

.. image:: /_static/largest_vehicles/Knock_Nevis.jpg

This supertanker was 458 m long, just for the references

- for french: Montparnasse tower is 210 m high, Eiffel Tower is 324 m
- for New Yorker: Empire State Building is 443 m, One World Trace Center is 541 m
- For Tokyo-Jin: Tokyo Tower is 333m

There are other building taller of course, I just named a few *for scale* (no
banana here).

It was benched in january 2010, nowadays the largest floating ships are the
*Maersk Triple E class*:

.. image:: /_static/largest_vehicles/triplee.jpg

It is 400 m long by 59 m wide (some villages are smaller than that...). At this
time there are 6 in service and 10 others are in said to be in construction with
ever more ordered.

One of its interesting spec, is that it is a lot more efficient than comparable
ships, and has an announced carbon footprint 50% smaller than same sized ships.

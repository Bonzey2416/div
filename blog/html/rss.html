<h1>Human Brain and Cooking</h1>
<p>No I’m not talking about cooking the human brain, but about the fact that humans
is the only species that cooks its food. And there is a reason for that, this is
what allows us be how we are. Cooked food allows an easier way to digest food,
and to absorb more energy from the food than when eating it raw, so it is not
only a question of taste, or killing bacterias, but it also is a way to help our
digestive system get the most out of food in a shorter time.</p>
<p>In fact, if it was not for cooking, we would have to spend about the whole day
eating raw food to have enough energy to power our brain and body. The truth is
that our brain is just the same as any primate brain. The number of neurons for
a brain of a given size is the same for any primate, ours is simply bigger. Note
that I insisted on the <em>primate</em>, that is because we don’t have the biggest
brain, that probably would be the whale, brain, but we do have the highest
number of neurons, and that explains our cognitive abilities. It also is the
most energy hungry brain, and the only way we can be a viable species is by
cooking, and that is an amazing fact, that I find not known well enough.</p>
<p>To get more information on the subject, you can dive directly into the work of

shorter and yet very comprehensive version, watch this great <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ted.com/talks">TED talk</a> she gave:</p>

<h1>Maillard Reaction</h1>
<p>Did you know that seared steak, bread crust, French fries and more are coming
from the same exact chemical reaction? It is called the <em>Maillard Reaction</em>, you
can read more about it on <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction">Wikipedia</a>. It is one of the two
Nonenzymatic browning, the second is the caramelization. There also are other
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browning_(food_process)">Food Browning</a> that may
be worth a read if you are interested in the subject.</p>
<p>Back to the <em>Maillard Reaction</em>, the basic point is that amino acids and
reducing sugar gets combined. Most of the time, heat is what triggers the
reaction, but it can also happen without it in various cases, the more sugar and
amino acids the lower the temperature required is.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure, in the case of meat, you will need far more than what can
be achieved by water, that’s why boiled meat won’t get brown, and taste
different. That is why some recipes will require you to fry meat before adding
them to the stock.</p>
<p>Want to give it a try for yourself? You can follow the steps of this <a class="reference external" href="https://www.exploratorium.edu/cooking/meat/activity-maillard.html">experience</a>, it is
worth a try!</p>
<p>Interesting for Malt lovers, this reaction is also used to prepare the malt used
in whiskey and beers, that is what gives it its color. There is a very
interesting <a class="reference external" href="http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2012-12/beersci-how-beer-gets-its-color">article</a>
that goes in length about it if you wish to find out more.</p>
<p>And here is a video about <em>Maillard Reaction</em> and caramelization by

<h1>Blood and its color(s)</h1>
<p>We, as most mammals, have red blood. This is due to the presence of iron in our
blood, which when oxidize turns reddish.</p>
<div class="section" id="but-why-is-this-iron-there">
<h2>But why is this iron there?</h2>
<p>Well we all know we need oxygen in our body, that’s why we breathe, but we may
not realize that most of our cells requires oxygen to live, all over the body.</p>
<p>In order to propagate oxygen to our body we need <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin">hemoglobin</a>, it will provides a mean to
transport oxygen throughout our tissues so our cells can stay alive.</p>
<p>So there is iron, and there is oxygen, which lead to <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox">redox</a>, hence the red color.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="but-my-veins-are-blue">
<h2>But my veins are blue</h2>
<p>Yes, we do see them blue, but its <em>not</em> blue.  Some people will tell you
otherwise, but blood is never blue in human. Why we do perceive the veins blue
does seem to be a question without perfectly proven answer.</p>
<p>One of the most likely reason is the light and its energy that the blood and
skin will reflect and absorb. If you want to know more about this particular
topic, I invite you to read <a class="reference external" href="http://scienceblogs.com/scientificactivist/2008/04/17/why-are-veins-blue">this article</a>
which covers the topic pretty well, while providing more interesting links on
the subject.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-is-this-post-titled-color-s">
<h2>Why is this post titled color(s)?</h2>
<p>We do have have red blood, but there are other blood colors that exists, not in
humans through.</p>
<div class="section" id="bluish-blood">
<h3>Bluish blood</h3>
<p>Lobsters, squids and horseshoe crabs (amongst others) have a bluish blood, as
their blood contains <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemocyanin">hemocyanin</a>
where we have hemoglobin, and use copper (vs iron in human) as a medium of
transport.</p>
<p>You can have a look at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/06/st_processcrab/blood_and_its_color_s.html#slideid-77561">pictures of horseshoe crabs and their blood</a>, but
while you’re at it read more about the use of their blood to test drugs, and how
it probably saved a lot of people!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="green-blood">
<h3>Green blood</h3>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prasinohaema_virens">skink</a> lizard have
green blood. Apparently, it seems that a high level of bile molecules are
present in their blood, but also in other tissues, and even in bones apparently.</p>
<p>More on this on <a class="reference external" href="http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2013/09/30/why-do-mysterious-lizards-have-green-blood">National Geographic</a></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="yellow-blood">
<h3>Yellow blood</h3>
<p>Insects such a beetles are known to have yellow colored blood. Really, pure
blood should be clear in insect, they get color because of what is in it.</p>
<p>Insects don’t have lungs and the need to transport oxygen like us, they breathe
through their skin, and for most parts, blood does not carry oxygen and
therefore does not have hemoglobin on its equivalent, but it does carry
nutrients and hormones, so most of the time, their blood color is related to
what they have been eating.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="section" id="doppler-effect">
<h1>Doppler Effect</h1>
<p>Most people know about the <em>Doppler Effect</em>, some without knowing it, some had
to go through a Doppler ultrasound, some of us even know it causes the slide of
the sound in sirens passing by...</p>
<iframe allowfullscreen="1" frameborder="0" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/JZTKhswn684?feature=player_detailpage" width="640"> </iframe><p><strong>Definition</strong>: The Doppler effect (or Doppler shift), is the change in
frequency of a wave (or other periodic event) for an observer moving relative to
its source.</p>
<p>So what does that mean?</p>
<p>Sound and light are waves:</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/Wave.JPG" src="http://themoreyouknow.github.io/blog/html/_images/Wave.JPG"/>
<p>To perceive one of these, we need an emitter, and an observer, for the siren
example, the ambulance siren is the emitter, and the microphone recording the
sound, is the observer.</p>
<p>But as the emitter moves toward the observer, the wavelength are shortened, once
the ambulance has passed the observer, it gets further away from the observer,
and the wavelength is getting longer.</p>
<p>When the wavelength is shorter, a sound will have a higher pitch, once the
wavelength gets longer, the sound will have a lower pitch, thus creating the
change you can hear when the ambulance passes by.</p>
<p>A representation of the wave of a moving emitter:</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/500px-Doppler_effect_diagrammatic.svg.png" src="http://themoreyouknow.github.io/blog/html/_images/500px-Doppler_effect_diagrammatic.svg.png"/>
<p>There are a lot of usage for this effect, but 2 are more known to the public:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Car Speed Radar</li>
<li>Doppler ultrasound</li>
</ul>
<p>So when the police measure car speed to give you a ticket, they are using the
exact same principle, the radar will beam a wave at a known frequency, and
receive the beam reflected by the vehicle, having its wavelength impacted by the
vehicle speed, Based on the difference, the device will determine the speed.</p>
<p>In the case of  Doppler ultrasound used in medical imaging, it is actually used
to measure the flow of blood in the body.</p>
<p>Finally, I would add that the expansion rate of the universe, is measured using
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift">redshift</a> which are an example of the
Doppler effect.</p>
<p>For more examples of its usage, and more detailed explanations, don’t forget to
check <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect">Wikipedia</a> page, which is
quite complete!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="section" id="human-brain-and-cooking">
<h1>Human Brain and Cooking</h1>
<p>No I’m not talking about cooking the human brain, but about the fact that humans
is the only species that cooks its food. And there is a reason for that, this is
what allows us be how we are. Cooked food allows an easier way to digest food,
and to absorb more energy from the food than when eating it raw, so it is not
only a question of taste, or killing bacterias, but it also is a way to help our
digestive system get the most out of food in a shorter time.</p>
<p>In fact, if it was not for cooking, we would have to spend about the whole day
eating raw food to have enough energy to power our brain and body. The truth is
that our brain is just the same as any primate brain. The number of neurons for
a brain of a given size is the same for any primate, ours is simply bigger. Note
that I insisted on the <em>primate</em>, that is because we don’t have the biggest
brain, that probably would be the whale, brain, but we do have the highest
number of neurons, and that explains our cognitive abilities. It also is the
most energy hungry brain, and the only way we can be a viable species is by
cooking, and that is an amazing fact, that I find not known well enough.</p>
<p>To get more information on the subject, you can dive directly into the work of
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.suzanaherculanohouzel.com/lab">Suzana Herculano-Houzel</a> or, for a
shorter and yet very comprehensive version, watch this great <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ted.com/talks">TED talk</a> she gave:</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="section" id="maillard-reaction">
<h1>Maillard Reaction</h1>
<p>Did you know that seared steak, bread crust, French fries and more are coming
from the same exact chemical reaction? It is called the <em>Maillard Reaction</em>, you
can read more about it on <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction">Wikipedia</a>. It is one of the two
Nonenzymatic browning, the second is the caramelization. There also are other
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browning_(food_process)">Food Browning</a> that may
be worth a read if you are interested in the subject.</p>
<p>Back to the <em>Maillard Reaction</em>, the basic point is that amino acids and
reducing sugar gets combined. Most of the time, heat is what triggers the
reaction, but it can also happen without it in various cases, the more sugar and
amino acids the lower the temperature required is.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure, in the case of meat, you will need far more than what can
be achieved by water, that’s why boiled meat won’t get brown, and taste
different. That is why some recipes will require you to fry meat before adding
them to the stock.</p>
<p>Want to give it a try for yourself? You can follow the steps of this <a class="reference external" href="https://www.exploratorium.edu/cooking/meat/activity-maillard.html">experience</a>, it is
worth a try!</p>
<p>Interesting for Malt lovers, this reaction is also used to prepare the malt used
in whiskey and beers, that is what gives it its color. There is a very
interesting <a class="reference external" href="http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2012-12/beersci-how-beer-gets-its-color">article</a>
that goes in length about it if you wish to find out more.</p>

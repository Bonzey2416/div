<h1>All about Garlic</h1>
<p>Not really a spice, not really a vegetable, the garlic is part of the onion
genus, and we will now have a look at more information about it.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/opened_garlic.jpg" src="http://themoreyouknow.github.io/blog/html/_images/opened_garlic.jpg"/>
<div class="section" id="choice-preservation">
<h2>Choice &amp; preservation</h2>
<p>A quality garlic is easily spotted, head should be well rounded, and by a single
touch you should feel the firmness of the cloves in it.</p>
<p>To keep it longer, do not put your garlic in the fridge, this would reactivate
its germination and its development. The ideal place to store your garlic should
be:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>dry</li>
<li>out of direct sunlight</li>
<li>room temperature</li>
</ul>
<p>When well stored, you should be able to keep it up to few months.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="vocabulary">
<h2>Vocabulary</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>What is the <strong>head</strong>: it is the <em>bulb</em> (on the right)</li>
<li>What is the <strong>clove</strong>: these are the part inside the head (on the left)</li>
<li>What is the <strong>tunic</strong>: the skin of the bulb, surrounding the cloves</li>
<li>Its scientific name is <strong>Allium sativum</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="smell">
<h2>Smell</h2>
<p>The garlic smell is due to the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allicin">allicin</a>
it contains.</p>
<p>Its effect on breath can generally be reduced by removing the central sprout,
that can often be found inside cloves, plus this part generally have a bitter
taste and can have an impact on the final taste of your recipe.</p>
<p>To lighten you breath, a tip is to bite a strong coffee bean, if you don’t have
any, menthol candies and chewing-gum are still the best way to go.</p>
<p>On your hands, the best way to go are the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stainless_steel_soap">Stainless steel soap</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="garlic-in-kitchen">
<h2>Garlic in kitchen</h2>
<p>There are various way to consume garlic:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Unpeeled garlic: once cooked, it softens, and becomes creamy</li>
<li>Cooked garlic smell is less marked and less persistent</li>
<li>Garlic smell is released when chopped</li>
<li>Made in puree, it can mix easily with sauce</li>
</ul>
<p>To make garlic flavored vinaigrette, you can marinate garlic in oil, and then
use the oil for your vinaigrette, or make a puree and mix with vinegar.</p>
<p>To flavor your meat with garlic, like a roast beef, cut the cloves, pinch hole
in meat and slide the piece of clover in it, you should put them at regular
distance in your meat, and then cook like this.</p>
<p>Finally, you can rub garlic on some food, like toasted or hard bread, to make
garlic croutons.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Brain, Imagination, and Memories]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="section" id="the-brain-imagination-and-memories">
<h1>The Brain, Imagination, and Memories</h1>
<p>Did you know that when you <em>imagine</em> doing a movement for example, you activate
the same areas of your brain as if you were actually doing the said movement?</p>
<p>This gives a tremendous power to the brain on your body, I’ll try to show you
how far all this extends, it may be a bit lengthy, but bear with me, this is
worth it.</p>
<p>A common example is a tennis player thinking about how he serves before a game,
repeating the movements in his mind to be sure to remember every details. Well,
while he does this, his brain is actually using the same process as if he was
actually serving.</p>
<p>The same goes for senses, if you use your memory to think about a smell you
liked, you can trigger your brain in the same way as if you were actually
smelling it. And as the brain works a lot in association of things, that is where
your brain will also triggers associated memory, that is why a lot of us have
memory of smell, or taste of cookies, or other treats we loved in our childhood
that are associated with given moments of our life, of the presence of someone
familiar, a mother, a grandmother for example.</p>
<p>This is actually used in some cases of <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnotherapy">hypnotherapy</a> and in
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming">Neuro-linguistic programming</a> (NLP) like the one
called <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_neuro-linguistic_programming#Techniques">Anchoring</a>.</p>
<p>Anchoring is a very good example, as it makes you associate a state suited to
face a situation, to an action. An example would be best:</p>
<p>Assume you are someone with too much anxiety, you can try to remember a moment
of you life when you were perfectly calm and felt safe, think about this, and
try to feel every feeling associated, the sounds, the taste, the smell, what you
saw at this moment, the touch of the wind, or of a warm good old sweater on your
body. If you do this properly, your brain should feel like it was at this
moment, it will tell your body: <em>everything is alright</em>, and you should feel
that way.</p>
<p>But doing the whole process in the case of a panic attack is not possible, that
is why once you get to this state, you will choose a simple given action like
joining your index and thumb for example, doing this in full conscience,
concentrated on your action.</p>
<p>Because of the state you were in, and the act you just did, your brain will
associate the two. For a good <em>anchoring</em> it may be required to do this multiple
times. But once this anchor is properly set, you should be able to trigger the
state you were in, simply by doing the associated action.</p>
<p>This power of the brain is pretty amazing and has quite a lot of possible uses,
I actually discovered the basics of this principle in the following video. I
find it pretty interesting although, <strong>Martin L. Rossman</strong> does talk about the
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triune_brain">Triune Brain</a> which apparently has
been unanimously rejected by the scientific community (found in the NLP french
wikipedia page). Anyway, even if the principle of the three parts of the brain
explained there are not completely accurate, the principle stays the same, and
does work.</p>
<p>I suggest you have a look at the video, if you have some time in front of you:</p>
<iframe allowfullscreen="1" frameborder="0" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/KYJdekjiAog?feature=player_detailpage" width="640"> </iframe><p>In my opinion (I don’t claim I’m right about this), relaxation, part of meditation, of hypnotherapy
and NLP, and probably much more, are all taking advantage of this same capacity
of our mind to gets their benefit, and I’m pretty sure there is still a lot more
to learn about the subject.</p>

            <guid>http://themoreyouknow.github.io/blog/html/2014/02/28/lethal_doses.html</guid>
            <title><![CDATA[Lethal Doses]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="section" id="lethal-doses">
<h1>Lethal Doses</h1>
<p>A well known fact about alcohol, is that it should be consumed in reasonable
quantities. You probably have legal warning in advertisement for drinks in your
country. If that is of interest, you can have a look at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.icap.org/table/HealthwarningLabels">Health Warning Labels</a> for various countries.</p>
<p>But that’s not the point here, what I want to do, is to list the amount of some
common things we do intake regularly, and that can be lethal in higher
quantities, and try to relate it to the quantity of beverage or food we would
have to consume in order to reach this amount.</p>
<p>Obviously, this would have to be absorbed quite fast, as the body would try to
eliminate as much of it as fast as it can.</p>
<p>Remember that this are assumed lethal doses, serious problems will arise far
earlier! Please do not assume you can safely go to half of this without any
issues, plus all this is only theoretical.</p>
<div class="section" id="alcohol">
<h2>Alcohol</h2>
<p>The generally admitted lethal dose is of 0.4% <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_alcohol_content">Blood Alcohol Content</a>.</p>
<p>It <a class="reference external" href="http://www.alcohol.org.nz/alcohol-you/your-body-alcohol/health-effects/alcohol-poisoning">seems</a>
that sums up from 5 to 8g per kilogram for an adult. So if we take the lower
limit, and a person weighting 60kg, this means 300g of alcohol.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A bottle of Żubrówka is 700ml at 40% = 280g -&gt; 1.07 bottles</li>
<li>A bottle of red wine of 750ml, at 13% = 97.5g -&gt; 3.07 bottles</li>
<li>Beer in between at 6.5% in 33ml bottles = 2.145g -&gt; 139 bottles</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="caffeine">
<h2>Caffeine</h2>
<p>In human, the dose is estimated to be 150 to 200mg per kilogram. For an average
adult, <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine#Caffeine_toxicity">Wikipedia</a>
tells us that this means 80 to 100 cups of coffee.</p>
<p>That will obviously depends on the type an preparation of the coffee, but it
will still be quite hard to drink this much coffee in a short span of time. But
there are a lot of pills and candy with caffeine (some of you may know
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/homeoffice/food-caffeine">ThinkGeek’s Food &amp; Caffeine</a> section), which may
take you to the danger zone faster.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="potassium">
<h2>Potassium</h2>
<p>As I earlier shared on G+, potassium can be lethal too, and common source of
potassium are bananas: everything is explained <a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.howstuffworks.com/keep-asking/can-you-die-from-eating-too-many-bananas">right here</a>,
but to sum it up, you would need 195000mg of potassium, or about 487 bananas:
Good luck with that!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="vitamins">
<h2>Vitamins</h2>
<p>Ok, this one may not be one you’ll have to worry too often about in your life,
but I love the fact that after all the “Eat your vegetables, you need your
vitamins!”, we can die from too much of one of these vitamins.</p>
<p>Having too much of a given vitamin is known as <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_poisoning">Hypervitaminosis</a> which you can apparently have
for vitamins A, D, E and maybe K.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Vitamin A: Liver contains a lot of it, mostly in polar bear, seal, walrus,
moose and husky. Polar bear are the most known about this because explorer of
the Arctic regions came back with lot of illness due to it. Its toxicity
levels are kind of <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervitaminosis_A#Types_of_toxicity">complex</a>.</li>
<li>Vitamin D: It does seem that the only source to have more of it are supplement
orally taken.</li>
<li>Vitamin E: There is not much information about it... <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervitaminosis_E">Wikipedia page</a> page is quite short, and
there are not a lot of other sources online.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately for the kids, you won’t be able to tell your mom you’ve had enough
and she’s putting you at risk, finish your plate of broccoli!</p>
<p>There are quite a lot, and I won’t dive myself in all the drugs lethal doses,
but if you have more info, feel free to add information in the comments or on G+
:)</p>

<h1>Tickling</h1>
<p>Tickling is kind of odd, it is extremely hard to control for most people, and
yet, you can’t really tickle yourself.</p>
<p>The reaction you encounter when tickled is actually a panic and anxiety
reaction, it is a form of defense against possible crawling insect that may
be poisonous for example. So the body needs to react quickly to avoid any risk.</p>
<p>So why can’t I really tickle myself? Well that is because you won’t feel in
danger knowing you are the source of the tickling and that you control it.</p>
<p>Interesting enough, the reaction is not the same if you are tickled by someone
you actually are OK with tickling you, or not, probably based on the level of
confidence you have toward this person, thus adjusting the level of danger your
body feel and the reaction to the tickling.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="section" id="blood-and-its-color-s">
<h1>Blood and its color(s)</h1>
<p>We, as most mammals, have red blood. This is due to the presence of iron in our
blood, which when oxidize turns reddish.</p>
<div class="section" id="but-why-is-this-iron-there">
<h2>But why is this iron there?</h2>
<p>Well we all know we need oxygen in our body, that’s why we breathe, but we may
not realize that most of our cells requires oxygen to live, all over the body.</p>
<p>In order to propagate oxygen to our body we need <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin">hemoglobin</a>, it will provides a mean to
transport oxygen throughout our tissues so our cells can stay alive.</p>
<p>So there is iron, and there is oxygen, which lead to <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox">redox</a>, hence the red color.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="but-my-veins-are-blue">
<h2>But my veins are blue</h2>
<p>Yes, we do see them blue, but its <em>not</em> blue.  Some people will tell you
otherwise, but blood is never blue in human. Why we do perceive the veins blue
does seem to be a question without perfectly proven answer.</p>
<p>One of the most likely reason is the light and its energy that the blood and
skin will reflect and absorb. If you want to know more about this particular
topic, I invite you to read <a class="reference external" href="http://scienceblogs.com/scientificactivist/2008/04/17/why-are-veins-blue">this article</a>
which covers the topic pretty well, while providing more interesting links on
the subject.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-is-this-post-titled-color-s">
<h2>Why is this post titled color(s)?</h2>
<p>We do have have red blood, but there are other blood colors that exists, not in
humans through.</p>
<div class="section" id="bluish-blood">
<h3>Bluish blood</h3>
<p>Lobsters, squids and horseshoe crabs (amongst others) have a bluish blood, as
their blood contains <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemocyanin">hemocyanin</a>
where we have hemoglobin, and use copper (vs iron in human) as a medium of
transport.</p>
<p>You can have a look at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/06/st_processcrab/blood_and_its_color_s.html#slideid-77561">pictures of horseshoe crabs and their blood</a>, but
while you’re at it read more about the use of their blood to test drugs, and how
it probably saved a lot of people!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="green-blood">
<h3>Green blood</h3>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prasinohaema_virens">skink</a> lizard have
green blood. Apparently, it seems that a high level of bile molecules are
present in their blood, but also in other tissues, and even in bones apparently.</p>
<p>More on this on <a class="reference external" href="http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2013/09/30/why-do-mysterious-lizards-have-green-blood">National Geographic</a></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="yellow-blood">
<h3>Yellow blood</h3>
<p>Insects such a beetles are known to have yellow colored blood. Really, pure
blood should be clear in insect, they get color because of what is in it.</p>
<p>Insects don’t have lungs and the need to transport oxygen like us, they breathe
through their skin, and for most parts, blood does not carry oxygen and
therefore does not have hemoglobin on its equivalent, but it does carry
nutrients and hormones, so most of the time, their blood color is related to
what they have been eating.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="section" id="doppler-effect">
<h1>Doppler Effect</h1>
<p>Most people know about the <em>Doppler Effect</em>, some without knowing it, some had
to go through a Doppler ultrasound, some of us even know it causes the slide of
the sound in sirens passing by...</p>
<iframe allowfullscreen="1" frameborder="0" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/JZTKhswn684?feature=player_detailpage" width="640"> </iframe><p><strong>Definition</strong>: The Doppler effect (or Doppler shift), is the change in
frequency of a wave (or other periodic event) for an observer moving relative to
its source.</p>
<p>So what does that mean?</p>
<p>Sound and light are waves:</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/Wave.JPG" src="http://themoreyouknow.github.io/blog/html/_images/Wave.JPG"/>
<p>To perceive one of these, we need an emitter, and an observer, for the siren
example, the ambulance siren is the emitter, and the microphone recording the
sound, is the observer.</p>
<p>But as the emitter moves toward the observer, the wavelength are shortened, once
the ambulance has passed the observer, it gets further away from the observer,
and the wavelength is getting longer.</p>
<p>When the wavelength is shorter, a sound will have a higher pitch, once the
wavelength gets longer, the sound will have a lower pitch, thus creating the
change you can hear when the ambulance passes by.</p>
<p>A representation of the wave of a moving emitter:</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/500px-Doppler_effect_diagrammatic.svg.png" src="http://themoreyouknow.github.io/blog/html/_images/500px-Doppler_effect_diagrammatic.svg.png"/>
<p>There are a lot of usage for this effect, but 2 are more known to the public:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Car Speed Radar</li>
<li>Doppler ultrasound</li>
</ul>
<p>So when the police measure car speed to give you a ticket, they are using the
exact same principle, the radar will beam a wave at a known frequency, and
receive the beam reflected by the vehicle, having its wavelength impacted by the
vehicle speed, Based on the difference, the device will determine the speed.</p>
<p>In the case of  Doppler ultrasound used in medical imaging, it is actually used
to measure the flow of blood in the body.</p>
<p>Finally, I would add that the expansion rate of the universe, is measured using
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift">redshift</a> which are an example of the
Doppler effect.</p>
<p>For more examples of its usage, and more detailed explanations, don’t forget to
check <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect">Wikipedia</a> page, which is
quite complete!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="section" id="human-brain-and-cooking">
<h1>Human Brain and Cooking</h1>
<p>No I’m not talking about cooking the human brain, but about the fact that humans
is the only species that cooks its food. And there is a reason for that, this is
what allows us be how we are. Cooked food allows an easier way to digest food,
and to absorb more energy from the food than when eating it raw, so it is not
only a question of taste, or killing bacterias, but it also is a way to help our
digestive system get the most out of food in a shorter time.</p>
<p>In fact, if it was not for cooking, we would have to spend about the whole day
eating raw food to have enough energy to power our brain and body. The truth is
that our brain is just the same as any primate brain. The number of neurons for
a brain of a given size is the same for any primate, ours is simply bigger. Note
that I insisted on the <em>primate</em>, that is because we don’t have the biggest
brain, that probably would be the whale, brain, but we do have the highest
number of neurons, and that explains our cognitive abilities. It also is the
most energy hungry brain, and the only way we can be a viable species is by
cooking, and that is an amazing fact, that I find not known well enough.</p>
<p>To get more information on the subject, you can dive directly into the work of
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.suzanaherculanohouzel.com/lab">Suzana Herculano-Houzel</a> or, for a
shorter and yet very comprehensive version, watch this great <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ted.com/talks">TED talk</a> she gave:</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="section" id="maillard-reaction">
<h1>Maillard Reaction</h1>
<p>Did you know that seared steak, bread crust, French fries and more are coming
from the same exact chemical reaction? It is called the <em>Maillard Reaction</em>, you
can read more about it on <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction">Wikipedia</a>. It is one of the two
Nonenzymatic browning, the second is the caramelization. There also are other
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browning_(food_process)">Food Browning</a> that may
be worth a read if you are interested in the subject.</p>
<p>Back to the <em>Maillard Reaction</em>, the basic point is that amino acids and
reducing sugar gets combined. Most of the time, heat is what triggers the
reaction, but it can also happen without it in various cases, the more sugar and
amino acids the lower the temperature required is.</p>
